# This file gives an overview on how to organize files for and work on
# the ADLTM project in Github. Setting it up may be a bit inconvenient at
# first, but saves a *lot* of effort afterwards.
#
# If you haven't cloned this repo yet, i.e. if you are reading this on
# Thomas' Github page, follow these steps:
#
#   1) Create an account on github if you don't have one already.
#
#   2) In your editor settings, make sure that you are connecting to
#   your Github account. In PyCharm, go on Preferences -> Version Control ->
#   Github and login.
#
#   3) Go to https://github.com/tcweiss/ADLTM and click on the green button
#   on the top right that says "Code". You should see a link. Copy it.
#
#   4) In your editor, open a new project by choosing the option "from version
#   control". You will be asked to enter a URL. Enter the link you copied. You
#   should now have a copy of the repo on your machine.
#
#
# If anything seems messed up, ask for help in the Whatsapp group. If everything
# worked, you should see that we have three folders: one for the data/import, one
# for the modeling stuff, and one for the dashboard. If you create new content,
# please put it the relevant folder, as projects can otherwise become pretty messy
# pretty quickly.
#
# Always remember to pull regularly in order to avoid merge conflicts. Also, I
# recommend turning on notifications for the repo so you know when someone changed
# something.
